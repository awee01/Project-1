permalink: /index.html

This website is a website catered towards individuals looking to promote their business online.

I have modified both the index.html and style.css files and have noted my comments in both.

Changes to the index.html are replacing multiple <divs> with various semantic tags for developper clarity. I also fixed an error at a certain link not working. I also removed the footer content in order to edit the webpage to look like the desired image.

Changes to the style.css are compressing various redundant code into smaller code for ease of reading, rather than constant repetition.
